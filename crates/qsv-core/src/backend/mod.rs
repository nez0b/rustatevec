//! The `Backend` trait — **the pluggable seam**.
//!
//! Everything above this line (circuit, gates, fusion) is backend-agnostic. A backend owns
//! the amplitude storage (`type State`) and the gate-application kernels. This is the seam
//! behind which a future CUDA/cuTile or Metal/wgpu backend will live **without touching the
//! circuit/gate layer**. Leak-proofing rules, enforced by the signatures below:
//!
//! - `State` is an associated type — CPU uses host [`StateVector`], a GPU backend would use
//!   an opaque device handle. No method ever hands out a `&mut [R]` to host memory.
//! - Reductions ([`probabilities`](Backend::probabilities), and later `sample`/`expectation`)
//!   are backend methods, so a GPU computes them on-device rather than forcing a copy back.
//! - [`download`](Backend::download) is the single explicit device→host boundary crossing
//!   (tests / CLI only).
//!
//! v0.0 exposes one general `apply(matrix, qubits)`; arity-specialized fast paths
//! (`apply_1q`, `apply_diagonal`, …) are added with the optimized CPU backend.
